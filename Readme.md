## Type-challenges
[Type-challenges](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges) is a open-source repository is used to practice how to declare a type in the typescript.
The first submit I did is Jan 12, 2022, 
Feb 29, 2022 I finish all the challenges except extremely questions.
In the process of solving these challenges, I not only learn how to use TypeScript, but also had more deep understanding on the TypeScript grammar. It is a good material to learning how to Typescript work and how to use it.
Next, I will continue to view more ts project and grammar documentation.
